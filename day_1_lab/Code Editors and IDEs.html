  <h3>Code Editors and Evironments for Client Side Development</h3>
       
          <p>As developers, there are few pieces of software we will 
spend as much time with as code editors. What follows is a survey of 
eight of the most popular client-side editors for the Mac platform.</p>
<p>While there are many code editors out there that support client-side 
as well as application and server-side development, we've focused on 
editors and IDEs (interactive development environments) marketing 
themselves for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript design and development.</p>
<h3><strong>Text Editors</strong> &amp; IDEs</h3>

    <td width="542"><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler">TextWrangler</a>
 (Bare Bones) This light-weight "little brother" app to the more 
extensive BBEdit IDE, TextWrangler's simple color coding, built in 
text-transformations and FTP support have made it the go-to for many 
developers who want to make a quick change.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a>
 - Version 2 is in beta which means that you can use it as long as you 
don't mind the occasional "don't forget to buy it" pop up alert. It is 
not a full-featured application like many of the others listed here, but
 many enjoy the minimalism and speed of the light-weight editor. The 
introspective auto completion and innovative scrolling preview side bar 
are personal favorites.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit">Komodo Edit</a>
 (Active State) This application boasts a "Fast Open" feature which is 
attractive to developers wanting to get a quick look at a file.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a> (MacRabbit) The selection of plug-ins for Espresso, cleverly called <em>sugars,</em>
 provide extensibility, but fall short of the plug-in libraries 
available for Coda and Eclipse-based editors like Aptana. I particularly
 like the CSS3 support and the DOM viewer incorporated in the view. Keep
 in mind that this is software that is maintained by a group of 
hardworking students, so updates are less than frequent.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>
 (Jet Brains) A lighter, quicker version than the Java IDE IntelliJIDEA 
that is built specifically for JavaScript developers. The auto-complete 
and error spotting is one of the most comprehensive of the applications 
listed here. And the cherry on top is that it is <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/eforms/classroomRequest.action?licenseRequest=WSCL">free for educational purposes</a>!</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>
 (Panic) A favorite IDE among mac web developers, Coda just released its
 version 2.0 which brings in many features other editors already have 
and adds features like Git tie-ins (in addition to SubVersion) for 
managing source code.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Dreamweaver</a>
 (Adobe) Like other Adobe products, the Dreamweaver IDE has developed a 
reputation for slowness and bloat.  It's also worth noting that its 
WYSWIG (what you see is what you get) capabilities it has earned a 
reputation for being the non-developers development tool.The CS6 version
 does boast a nice addition to its mobile web support and tie-in with 
Phone Gap for producing phone applications.</span></td>

    <td><span style="width: 300px"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Aptana Studio</a> -(Appcelerator) Athough this IDE is one of the newer ones on this list, Aptana is already <em>very</em>
 popular among web developers. Because it is a build of the open-source 
Eclipse engine, users have access to an extensive plugin library and 
also inherit the Eclipse's slow speed. It also comes with some very nice
 ftp and git source control integration.</span></td>
