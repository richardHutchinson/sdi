				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>For this assignment you will need to think of a story that has a 
connection to your life.  It could be an adventure, a hobby, your job, a
 skill that you have, or anything of the like.  You will then take that 
story, and tell it just a few sentences.  As such, the story should be 
short and simple and not need any great amount of backstory.</p>
    <p>This story is very similar to the way you may receive the 
specifics of an app you'll be working on.  As with any word problem, the
 first thing you should do is break it down into it's important points, 
so you'll do the same thing with your story.  You will break it down 
into a bulleted list of steps. Each bullet should contain only a few 
words and a single action item or decision point.  So, if a decision is 
being made, it should be followed by a couple of actions that might take
 place based on the decision that's made.</p>
    <p>Possible stories might incldue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A day at work</li>
        <li>Preparing a meal</li>
        <li>Getting ready for a trip</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The story should include at least 3 action items and 1 decisions 
point which results in various action items.  An action item could be 
anything from "The sun rises off the starboard bow." to "I tell the crew
 to swab the deck."  A decision point may be something like "Ahoy mateys
 its time for an inspection! Let's see if this deck is ready for 
sailin." resulting in the possible action items "Ye be walking the plank
 if it ain't!" or "We be drinking some rum if it are!"</p>
    <p>You may choose to use the same story you will be using for your 
first deliverable on Thursday, but it is not required.  That said, this 
is a good opportunity to test out your assignment story and receive some
 feedback.  The purpose of this assignment is to help you in learning 
how to formulate a story and simplify it into manageable pieces.  (Pro 
Tip: The week 1 deliverable has 3 decision points and at least 5 action 
items.)</p>
