			<h1>Using Functions</h1>
			<div class="overview">
				<p>In this activity, you'll use functions to create a rudimentary 
calculator that will allow you to enter two numbers and an operation to 
receive an outcome based on the operation entered.</p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Don't forget to do your GitHub commits and pushes throughout the 
process of code creation.  You should have at least four solid commits 
by the time you're done (one for each function).</p>
<p>Downlooad and decompress the zip file attached to this activity.  
Rename the JavaScript file so that it matches the naming convention of 
lastname_firstname_lab5.js.  Don't forget to make this change in the 
HTML file as well or your code will not run.</p>
<p>Create four functions.  All four functions should accept two number 
arguments.  Each function should perform a different arithmetical 
operation: division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.  Each 
function should then return the outcome of the operation.</p>
<p>Next, you'll create prompts that allow a user to enter three items: 
the two numbers being manipulated and the operation to be performed.  
For example, if you want to add two numbers together, the first two 
prompts should accept and parse values as numbers, and the third prompt 
should accept something that signifies the operation (such as +. -. /, *
 or the words add, subtract, multiply, divide).  Include the operation 
signifier in the prompt so that a user knows what must be entered.</p>
<p>The number returned should be stored in a variable and then output to
 the console in some meaningful way so that a user can see what numbers 
have been used, what operation was performed, and what the outcome is.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind: the code should always return meaningful 
data.  Thus, if a user were to try to divide by zero, the code should 
not throw an error; it should give the user useful feedback.</p>
<p>When complete, compress all the files into one zip file as lastname_firstname_lab5.zip and upload it to this activity.</p>
