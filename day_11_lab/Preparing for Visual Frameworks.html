				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				Titanium is a development tool that you can use to create mobile 
apps using JavaScript.  You'll be using it in the next several coding 
classes, so it's important to have the tool set up and ready to go by 
the time you arrive in VFW.  Some of you may have already installed this
 tool in a previous class.  If not, this activity will give you the 
guide you need to begin working with Titanium.<p></p>
