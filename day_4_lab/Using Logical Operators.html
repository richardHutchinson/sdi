				<p>Now that you know a little more about logical operators, let's use them to fill in some truth tables!</p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Download the sdi-lab4-logic.zip and extract the files.  You will 
find that it contains several files, including a JavaScript file and a 
Word document.</p>
<p>Open the Word document, and you will see some truth tables that need 
to be filled in.  You'll use code to help you do this.  The 
logic-tables.js file is already attached to the sdi-lab4.html file, so 
go ahead and load it into your browser to run the JavaScript.  Click the
 appropriate buttons in the confirm boxes and you will see the outcome 
in the console.  Reload the page and select different combinations of 
true (OK) and false (Cancel) to complete the first truth table.</p>
<p>Now, it's your turn!</p>
<p>Open the logic-tables.js file in your code editor and change the 
conditional so that it uses the OR logical operator.  You may want to 
alter the outputs as well to reflect this change to the logic.  Now, run
 the code again and fill in the second truth table.</p>
<p>Continue changing the code so that you can complete the remaining 
truth tables.  But, for the last three, create a loop so that the 
conditional will run the necessary number of times to complete the 
table.  You also will need to create additional variables and confirms 
to gather all the data needed for some of the later truth tables.</p>
<p>Save the document as lastname_firstname_logic4.docx.  Also save the 
final version of your JavaScript code.  Compress the document and the 
other sdi-lab4-logic files into one zip file that you can uplaod to FSO.</p>
