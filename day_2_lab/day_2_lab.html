				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Download the zip file attached to this activity and extract the 
files.  You should have a JavaScript file (.js), a CSS file (.css), and 
an HTML file (.html).  You will notice that the .js file is named 
"rename-me.js".  Your first task is to rename this file to 
lastname_firstname_lab2.js using your last name and first name.  Next, 
you'll need to change the script tag in the HTML file to match this 
change.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that the slightest variation of the name of the file in the script tag will keep the JavaScript from loading.</strong></p>
<p>You can verify that the file is attached correctly by opening the 
HTML file in your browser.  An alert box should pop up letting you know 
that JavaScript works.</p>
<p><strong><u>Task the First</u></strong></p>
<p>Begin by creating four (4) different variables of the following data types:
</p><ul>
<li>String</li>
<li>String with escapes</li>
<li>Number</li>
<li>Boolean</li>
</ul>
<p>The values should be related in some way so that when they are output
 later, you can use them to tell a story or describe a task.  You can 
use your story idea from the first lab as a basis if you like.</p>
<p><strong><u>Task the Second</u></strong></p>
<p>Create console.logs to output the variables in some meaningful way.  
In other words, you should concatenate the variable values with other 
text so that your output tells a story or describes a task.  Again, you 
can use your story post as a starting point for this if you like.</p>
<p><strong><u>Task the Third</u></strong></p>
<p>Create a confirm() dialog box that changes the value of your Boolean 
variable.  Then, create a prompt() dialog box that changes the value of 
either a number or a string variable.  If you choose to change your 
number variable, you must use parseInt or parseFloat to make it a number
 data type.  Create additional console.logs to output these new values. 
 Do so in a way that helps to tell the story.  Once complete, push your 
files to your GitHub account and compress the files so you can upload 
them to this activity.</p>
<p><strong><u>Task the Fourth</u></strong></p>
<p>Read pages 51-66 in Beginning JavaScript before the next class.</p>
