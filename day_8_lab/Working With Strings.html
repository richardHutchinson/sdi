				<p>Today was all about strings and string properties and methods.  
This lab combines what you've learned with problem-solving so that you 
can create functions that manipulate strings in useful ways.</p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Download the attached zip file and decompress it.  You'll find 
the same file structure as before with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 
files.</p>
<p>The following problems involve string objects.  Thus, you can use the
 string properties and methods to help some them.  You are free to do 
additional research on some methods not covered in class.  Create one 
function to solve each problem.  When complete, upload all of your files
 to GitHub and then zip the files and upload the zipped file to FSO.</p>
<p><u><strong>Problem 1</strong></u></p>
<p>Create a function that will accept a string as and argument and then 
check to see if the string follows the pattern of an email address, such
 as aaa@bbb.ccc.  Keep in mind that all you need to check is that the 
string contains only one @ symbol and no spaces.  There is no need to 
check for .com, .edu, etc.  The result should be output to the console 
in a meaningful way.</p>
<p><u><strong>Problem 2</strong></u></p>
<p>Create a function that will accept three strings.  The first will be a
 list of items separated by a given string, the second will be that 
string separator, and the third will be a new separator.  The function 
will then perfrom the task of replacing the first separator with the 
second and return the result.  Thus, a list such as "a,b,c,d" with the 
first separator being "," and the second separator being "/" would 
become "a/b/c/d".  Again, be sure to output the result in a meaningful 
way.</p>
