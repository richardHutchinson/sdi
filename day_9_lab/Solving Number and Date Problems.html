to you in JavaScript.  Let's put that into practice by solving the 
following problems.</p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Download the attached zip file and decompress it.  You'll find 
the same file structure as before with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 
files.</p>
<p>The following problems involve number and Date objects.  Thus, you 
can use the number and Date methods to help solve them.  You may even 
need to sdo a little research on some methods not covered in class to 
solve the problems.  Create one function to solve each problem.  When 
complete, upload all your files to GitHub and then zip the files and 
upload the file to FSO.</p>
<p><u><strong>Problem 1 - Format a number</strong></u></p>
<p>Create a function that will format a number to a specified number of 
decimal places.  The function will need to accept two numbers: a number 
to be formatted and a number that represented decimal places.  It should
 return the newly formatted number.  Don't forget to output the number 
in a meaningful way.</p>
<p><u><strong>Problem 2 - Number vs. String</strong></u></p>
<p>As you have learned, there is a difference between a number as a 
string data type and a number as a Number data type. For this task, you 
will simply need to send a string into the function and return it as a 
Number. If you want to get 
creative, you also can add a conditional to determine if the string sent
 into the function is a number before you do the conversion.</p>
<p><u><strong>Problem 3 - Date Differences</strong></u></p>
<p>Create a function that will find the difference between two dates.  
This function will require three parameters. The ﬁrst two will be dates 
that you want to compare, and the third will be a string to determine if
 the function returns hours or days. The function will then perform the 
math 
necessary to ﬁnd the difference between the two dates and return the 
choice as hours or days.  Again, remember to output the returned value 
in a meaningful way.</p>
