			<h1>Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="overview">
				<p>The Day 10 Lab is all about problem-solving since this will be 
one of the important aspects of the practical you'll be taking in the 
next class.  We'll start with some sudoku puzzles and finish with some 
problems to solve in code!</p>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>Download the attached zip file and decompress it.  You will find a
 sudoku.docx file in the folder.  This file contains three (3) sudoku 
puzzles for you to complete.  Don't forget to add your name and term to 
the top of the document.  Save the completed document so that you can 
add it to the compressed file you will upload later.</p>
    <p>The next part of the activity includes solving some math puzzles 
using JavaScript.  Download and decompress the sdi-lab10.zip file and 
load the JavaScript file into your code editor.  These problems have 
been culled from ProjectEuler.net.  While you are encouraged to use the 
Web to help research the problem, copying and pasting the code is not 
only academically dishonest, but it defeats the purpose of this 
exercise, which is to strengthen your problem-solving skills.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5</u></strong></p>
    <p>If you were to list all the whole numbers below 10 that are 
multiples of 3 or 5, they would be 3, 5, 6, and 9.  This is because 3 x 1
 = 3, 5 x 1 = 5, 3 x 2 = 6, and 3 x 3 = 9.  The sum of these multiples 
(3 + 5 + 6 + 9) is 23.  Your task is to create a function that will find
 the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers</u></strong></p>
    <p>If you don't know what the Fibonacci sequence is, it is generated
 by adding two numbers to get the next element in a list of numbers.  
Thus, a Fibonacci sequence that starts at 1 would begin 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 
13, 21, 34, 55, 89....  This is because 1 + 2 = 3, which gives us our 
first three numbers (1, 2, 3).  The next number is found by adding 2 + 3
 = 5, so our sequence increased to 1, 2, 3, 5.  The next number is found
 by adding 3 + 5 = 8, so our sequence increases to 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so
 on.</p>
    <p>Create a function that finds the sum of all the even-numbered elements in a series that does not exceed four million.</p>
