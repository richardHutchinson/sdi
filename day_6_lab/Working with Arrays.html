				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>This first activity consists of several parts that will give you a
 chance to create arrays, work with functions, and build loops.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a global array of related items.  These could be names of family members, sports teams, states, anything you like.</li>
    <li>Create a second global array with the same number of elements.  
Each element in this array should describe an element in the first 
array.  Thus, if your first array contains sports teams, the second 
array could include the state to which that team belongs.  You should 
have one descirption for each element in the first array, so they will 
be the same length.</li>
    <li>Create a function that can accept two arguments.</li>
    <li>Inside the function, create a loop that uses the length of the array to dictate the number of times the loop will run.</li>
    <li>Each time the loop runs, pull another element of the arrays and 
output them in a meaningful fashion to the console, such as "John Adams 
is my father" where "John Adams" comes from the first array and "father"
 comes from the second array.</li>
    <li>Don't forget to create a function call that sends the arrays as parameters!</li>
    <li>Next, use an array method to make some change to your arrays.  
You could use .push() to add an element or .pop() to remove one, etc.  
Do some research on array methods and be creative!  If adding or 
removing items, remember to run that method on both arrays so that the 
lengths will remain the same.</li>
    <li>Create a second function call that sends the altered arrays to the function so that the new arrays are output to the console.</li>
    </ol>
<p>When complete, compress all the files into a zip and upload it to FSO.</p>
